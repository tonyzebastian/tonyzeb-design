                <p>
                    This is a typical conversation I have with friends and family about my work situation. It wasn&apos;t a deliberate choice to go remote. Back in late 2018, I was looking to switch from being a senior business analyst at Infosys to trying my luck in the design field. I started applying for jobs.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    Around that time, a friend of mine had been working remotely for about a year and seemed to be thriving, working from their hometown with occasional travel. That inspired me to explore remote job opportunities.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    After a few interviews, I landed a remote job at AVRL as a Visual Designer. Coincidentally, another friend of mine also joined the remote work trend. So, we both decided to relocate back to our hometown, Thodupuzha.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    Fast forward 15 months, and I&apos;m still in the same job, in the same place. The ongoing pandemic hasn&apos;t changed my lifestyle much. This article is a recap of my remote working experience so far.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section className="mb-10 mx-6">
                <h2 className="mb-2">Good Stuff</h2>
                <h4 className="mb-2">The freedom to choose location</h4>
                <p>
                    This is one of the best parts of a remote job (if your job allows it, not all do). It means you can work from pretty much anywhere, whether it&apos;s switching up your scenery every now and then or living the digital nomad life. The only requirement? A solid internet connection, which thankfully most remote areas have these days.
                    <br/>
                    When I first started this job, I wasted no time in ditching the hustle and bustle of the city for my cozy hometown, Thodupuzha. But that&apos;s not all- I&apos;ve also worked from different cities across India, catching up with friends and family, attending events, and exploring new places along the way.
                </p>

                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">Extra time at your disposal</h4>
                <p>
                    Having extra time on your hands is one of the perks of being a full-time remote worker. Without the daily commute, long lunch breaks, or office chitchat, you&apos;ve got more hours in the day to do your thing. Whether it&apos;s working on a side hustle, picking up new skills, or just taking care of personal stuff, the possibilities are endless.
                    <br/>
                    For me, having that extra time meant diving into things I&apos;ve always wanted to do. In 2019 alone, I managed to read 8 books (compared to zero in 2018), learn how to swim, and even started taking violin lessons (though I eventually had to drop them due to time constraints). Plus, I found myself doing more art than ever before - talk about a creative streak!
                </p>

                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">Less Distraction- Enhanced productivity</h4>
                <p>
                    Working from home definitely has its perks when it comes to staying focused and getting stuff done. Without the usual office distractions, you can really zone in on your work.
                    <br/>
                    I&apos;ve noticed that I&apos;m way more productive when I&apos;m working from home. I can tackle tasks without any interruptions, and I&apos;m able to stay in the zone for longer stretches of time. It&apos;s amazing how much more I can accomplish in a day compared to when I was in the office!
                </p>

                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">Lower cost of living</h4>
                <p>
                    Working remotely has been a game-changer for my finances. With no need for a daily commute, I&apos;ve saved a ton on travel expenses. Plus, since I&apos;m working from home, there&apos;s no need to splurge on office attire or fancy lunches. I&apos;ve noticed a big dip in my overall living costs, from rent to food expenses.
                    <br/>
                    Before, I was constantly updating my wardrobe with new office-friendly clothes, but now, I only need to dress up for special occasions. It&apos;s amazing how much I&apos;ve been able to cut back on unnecessary spending!
                </p>


                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">More time with Family</h4>
                <p>
                    Remote work gives you more time with your family.This is especially useful for those who have older parents or a child. In most occassions you don&apos;t have to take a leave to get your family matters done or run an errand.
                </p>

            <section className="mb-10 mx-6">
                <h2 className="mb-2">Bad Stuff</h2>
                <p>
                    Remote work is not everyone&apos;s cup of tea. If you love being around people with constant office chatter and conversations, you might find it difficult to work alone. Additionally, working from home can be challenging for certain types of jobs. For example, if your job requires a high level of collaboration and frequent meetings, remote work may not be ideal.
                </p>

                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">Loss of social circle - the sense of belonging</h4>
                <p>
                    When working remotely, you tend to go out much less than with an office job, which means far fewer social interactions. My social interactions reduced drastically, and my friend circle shrank to a few close ones. Office parties, water cooler conversations, and office chatter give you a sense of belonging. But when you work from home, you are all by yourself, with only your inner voice to keep you company.
                </p>

                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">Office Time/Personal Time- Its all the same</h4>
                <p>
                    It can be difficult to separate office time and personal time if you don&apos;t have a properly planned timetable. Work can start as soon as you wake up, and you might not leave your workspace for hours. This can negatively impact your personal time, sometimes leaving you exhausted by the end of the day even if you haven&apos;t accomplished much.
                    <br/>
                    If the company operates globally, you may need to collaborate across different time zones. This can lead to meetings in the middle of the night that stretch on for hours, disrupting your sleep cycle.
                </p>

                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">Digital Medias- The new age distraction</h4>
                <p>
                    Working remotely, especially from home, means there are distractions everywhere- YouTube, Netflix, and, in my opinion, the biggest distraction of all, your bed. You might tell yourself you&apos;re going to take a quick 5-minute break, but if you lay down with your phone in hand, that 5 minutes can easily stretch into 1-2 hours.
                </p>

                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">Loneliness and depression</h4>
                <p>
                    There are bad days, and then there are really bad days. The inner chattering voice grows louder, and when you look around, you&apos;re alone in a room with a handful of lifeless objects. These moments can easily drag you down into a rabbit hole.
                </p>

                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">No personal connection with collegues</h4>
                <p>
                    Understanding your colleagues- their personalities, work styles, etc is crucial for deep collaboration and excellent work. Collaborating through Slack or Zoom with people sitting in different corners of the world doesn&apos;t serve the purpose as well. It&apos;s challenging to create a personal connection with a colleague you&apos;ve only met once or twice. The sense of team becomes vague and poorly defined.
                </p>

                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">Travel and work is not always a viable option</h4>
                <p>
                    Being a designer, I rely on a second screen for my workflow. When I travel, I can&apos;t carry my 23-inch monitor and have to rely on my 13-inch laptop, which is really a pain. Some people need to get accustomed to their surroundings to feel comfortable and do excellent work, which is difficult when you&apos;re traveling all the time.
                </p>

                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">Other Distractions</h4>
                <p>
                    Remote work does come with the same level, or even more, distractions than an office job. Firstly, there&apos;s nobody to monitor you, which can lead to laziness and a relaxed attitude.

                <h2 className="mb-4">Learnings</h2>

                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">Self Discipline and Timetable</h4>
                <p>
                    Having control over yourself and following a timetable are the most important lessons I learned from my remote working experience. A timetable ensures you know what to do next, helping you stay organized and get things done throughout the day.
                </p>

                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">Ownership of work</h4>
                <p>
                    Remote work requires taking ownership of your tasks. Your manager and colleagues trust you to complete your work on time. It&apos;s your responsibility to gather all the necessary resources and details to ensure the task is completed perfectly. Additionally, when you&apos;re available or have completed a task, it&apos;s your responsibility to inform your manager so you can be assigned new tasks. This proactive approach fosters positive relationships with your colleagues, even when you&apos;re miles apart.
                </p>


                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">Clear communication</h4>
                <p>
                    Most communication occurs via platforms like Slack, emails, or video calls. Therefore, it&apos;s crucial to be precise and clear in your communication. Ensure you include all relevant information and don&apos;t hesitate to ask for clarification if something isn&apos;t clear to you.
                </p>

                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">Set boundaries between work and personal life</h4>
                <p>
                    Work and personal time should be clearly defined to make life easier. In my previous office job, once I left the office, a switch flipped, and I no longer had to worry about work. Similarly, even though you&apos;re working from home, it&apos;s essential to separate work and personal life, even if they happen in the same place.
                </p>


                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">Exercise</h4>
                <p>
                    Taking care of your health is crucial. Have a plan for exercise and stay hydrated. In a remote job, you may spend long hours in your room, leading to less movement. Remember to stretch regularly to keep the blood flowing.
                </p>

                <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2">Put in that extra effort to socialise</h4>
                <p>
                    Humans are inherently social creatures. Prolonged isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness and self-doubt, especially in remote work settings. It&apos;s essential to make a conscious effort to socialize by making plans and meeting with friends and acquaintances. Attending conferences and exhibitions related to your field of work or interests can also connect you with like-minded individuals, fostering lasting connections.
                </p>

                <h2 className="mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Remote work is increasingly popular, especially among younger generations. However, it&apos;s important to recognize that both office and remote jobs have their pros and cons. Before diving in, take the time to research the company thoroughly and reflect on whether remote work aligns with your working style and preferences. <br/> Cheers to finding the right fit!
