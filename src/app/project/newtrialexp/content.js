    description: "As part of Postman's Growth team, I led the redesign of trial experiences to make them more timely, contextual, and value-driven. Teams previously discovered trials too late, onboarding felt disruptive, and communication didn't clearly show value or next steps. I worked on reimagining the first-time experience with earlier trial triggers and a cleaner introduction, while also improving in-app and end-state communication to connect usage with ROI and guide teams toward the right plan.",
