This simplified experimentation, reduced internal tech debt, and early prototypes with clients like KFC, Home Depot, and Snowflake showed strong interest.",

From there, users could drill down into details, explore causes, and uncover deeper patterns. The experience was structured into different sections, each tailored to a specific type of insight, supported by diverse visualizations that made complex data intuitive and engaging.",
