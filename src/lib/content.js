    text: "My journey began with a master's in marketing, where I discovered my fascination with branding, positioning, product strategy, and ultimately design. I started out as a Business Analyst at Infosys, but quickly realized it wasn't the right fit for me. Driven by curiosity, I taught myself design, transitioned into freelancing, and dove deep into honing my craft. Today, with around 7 years of experience, I've grown from Freelance Designer → Product Designer at Hypersonix → now a Product Designer at Postman. Currently, I'm based in Bangalore, India, though my roots are in the charming town of Thodupuzha, Kerala.",
